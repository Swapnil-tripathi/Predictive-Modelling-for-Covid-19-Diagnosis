# Predictive-Modelling-for-Covid-19-Diagnosis
This project aims to develop a precise and efficient machine learning model for predicting whether an individual is COVID-19 positive.
Given the ongoing challenges posed by various COVID-19 variants worldwide, the project focuses on enhancing the speed and accuracy of diagnosis using machine learning algorithms. 
The goal is to contribute to more effective medical care and alleviate the burden on healthcare systems.
# Steps
# Step 1: Dataset Loading and Initial Analysis
          * Loaded the dataset and conducted an initial analysis, including examining the shape, and data types, and displaying the top and bottom 5 rows.
# Step 2: Data Cleaning and Correction
          * Checked unique values in each column, corrected data types, and performed data cleaning by replacing missing values with mean or mode as appropriate.
# Step 3: Data Visualization
          * Utilized various charts such as heatmap, countplot, and pie chart to visualize key aspects, including COVID-19 status distribution, gender-wise COVID-19 positive cases, age distribution, and the 
          prevalence of symptoms like cough, breathing problems, sore throat, and fever.
# Step 4: Feature Engineering
           * Converted categorical data into numerical format through feature engineering, ensuring compatibility with machine learning models.
# Step 5: Modeling
           * Implemented different machine learning models, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and AdaBoost, to predict whether an individual is COVID-19 positive or not.
# Dependencies
  *  Python 3.x
  *  Google Colab
  *  Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, XGBoost
